## Summary
Expense tracker was developed to further reinforce my understanding of building front end website, and functionality was the main focus during development. Tools used: HTML, JavaScript, and CSS were used. I learned how to implement separation of concerns for functions, pass constants/variables into functions, add new table body/row/dataCell, add textContent property, add/remove parent/child element property, and add remove method.
