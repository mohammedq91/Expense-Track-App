## Summary
This project was written in HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. The purpose of this app was to help me to reinforce my JavaScript skills. I learned how to implement separation of concerns for functions, pass constants/variables into functions, add new table body/row/dataCell, add textContent property, add/remove parent/child element property, and add remove method.
